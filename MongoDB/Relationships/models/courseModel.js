const mongoose = require("mongoose");
// The `require` function in Node.js is used to import modules. It returns whatever was exported from the module being required.

// In your code snippet:

// ```javascript
// const mongoose = require("mongoose");
// ```

// `require("mongoose")` is importing the Mongoose module. The Mongoose module exports an object that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data with MongoDB. This object includes methods for defining schemas, connecting to your database, creating models, etc.

// So, `require("mongoose")` returns this Mongoose object, and `const mongoose` assigns this object to the variable `mongoose` for use in the rest of your file. Now you can use `mongoose.Schema`, `mongoose.model`, `mongoose.connect`, and other Mongoose methods by calling them on the `mongoose` variable.

const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    name: String,
    author: {
// The line of code you're looking at is part of a Mongoose schema definition in a Node.js application.

// ```javascript
// type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId
// ```

// This line is defining a field in a Mongoose schema to be of type `ObjectId`. `ObjectId` is a special type used by MongoDB to represent document IDs. It's a 12-byte identifier typically used to uniquely identify documents within a collection.

// `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId` is the way you specify an `ObjectId` type in a Mongoose schema. This is useful when you want to create relationships between different data by storing references to other document IDs.

// For example, if you have a `Course` model and an `Author` model, you might want to link each course to its author. You could do this by storing the `ObjectId` of the author in the course document:

// ```javascript
// const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
//   name: String,
//   author: {
//     type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
//     ref: 'Author'
//   }
// });
// ```

// In this example, the `author` field in the `courseSchema` is set to be an `ObjectId` that references the `Author` model. This means that when you create a new course, you can assign an author to it by storing the author's `ObjectId` in the `author` field.
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Author",
    },
  }
)

// The `mongoose.model` function in Node.js is used to create a model in Mongoose. A model is a constructor that creates instances of documents in MongoDB.

// In your code snippet:

// ```javascript
// const courseModel = mongoose.model("Course", courseSchema);
// ```

// `mongoose.model("Course", courseSchema)` is creating a new model named "Course" using the `courseSchema` schema. This model will be associated with the "Course" collection in your MongoDB database.

// The `mongoose.model` function returns this new model constructor, which you can then use to create and retrieve documents from the "Course" collection. In your code, this model constructor is being assigned to the `courseModel` variable.

// For example, you could use `courseModel` to create a new course document like this:

// ```javascript
// const newCourse = new courseModel({
//   name: 'Introduction to Programming',
//   author: '5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99' // some ObjectId
// });
// newCourse.save(callback); // save the document to the database
// ```

// Or to find a course document:

// ```javascript
// courseModel.findById('5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99', callback); // find a document by its id


const courseModel = mongoose.model("Course", courseSchema);

module.exports = courseModel;
